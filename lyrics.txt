[Verse 1]
Waking up to a brand new day,  
The sun is shining, lighting up my way.  
I feel the breeze, it’s calling me,  
To chase the dreams I’ve yet to see.  

[Chorus]  
I’ll rise above, I’ll touch the sky,  
Spread my wings, I’ll learn to fly.  
With every step, I’ll find my way,  
Tomorrow’s light begins today.  

[Verse 2]  
The world’s alive, it’s full of sound,  
A melody that spins around.  
In every note, in every beat,  
The rhythm guides my dancing feet.  

[Chorus]  
I’ll rise above, I’ll touch the sky,  
Spread my wings, I’ll learn to fly.  
With every step, I’ll find my way,  
Tomorrow’s light begins today.  

[Bridge]  
Through the storms and through the rain,  
I’ll hold on tight, I’ll bear the strain.  
The darkest night can’t dim the flame,  
I’ll burn with hope, I’ll call my name.  

[Chorus]  
I’ll rise above, I’ll touch the sky,  
Spread my wings, I’ll learn to fly.  
With every step, I’ll find my way,  
Tomorrow’s light begins today.
